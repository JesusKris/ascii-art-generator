## General Information
This project was made as a school project in [kood/Jõhvi](https://kood.tech/) (10.06.2021). 

The project required us to create a webpage which could transform user input into 3 different predefined ascii art fonts. 

The second task was to dockerize the web application.

  **NB! Different source control platform was used hence no commit history.**

## Features
- Transform your text into amazing ascii art font.

## Technologies Used
